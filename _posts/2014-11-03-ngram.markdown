## [2014 - N-gram-based Low-dimensional Representation for Document Classification](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6277.pdf)

#### Remi Lebret, Ronan Collobert

#### _Hypothesis / Main methods_

- N-grams can be represented by averaging/summing their corresponding word vectors. Then a K-means clustering approach can cluster semantically similar concepts (n-grams). Essentially, each n-gram is assigned to one of the _K_ clusters and each document is represented by a feature vector of dimension _K_ where elements are count based features.

#### _Results_

- Achieve better results in comparison with LDA / LSA.
